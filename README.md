# On Text Games Mode

A set of exercises and source data for getting used to text processing in Python.

Each top-level section in **Goals** is an idea or skill demonstrated by the prompts below it. Consider these prompts to be a starting place, not necessarily a checklist. They're roughly arranged by difficulty, but you can go in any order! Pick the prompts that sound interesting. Pick the next one you don't know how to do. Pick something to try that you don't yet know how to do. 

Doesn't matter, this is about finding a hint of something interesting and difficult and seeing where it can lead.

### Before you start

- Choose an editor and stick with it. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a great one.
  - Try installing some Python support. [If you're using VS Code, start here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python).
- Choose a terminal app and stick with it. On MacOS or Linux, any terminal app will do. On Windows, it wouldn't hurt to start with VS Code's built in terminal.
- Unzip `data/books.zip` to get at some text files to play with. If you have your own plain text files, use those! Or, search for interesting ones on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org), but make sure to stick with the "Plain Text UTF-8" format.

## Goals

- Printing
  - Read a file in and print it out.
  - Print each letter on its own line.
  - Print each word on its own line. 
  - Print each letter in alphabetical order.
  - Print each word in alphabetical order.
- Normalizing
  - Convert the text into a list of letters.
  - Convert the text into a list of words.
  - Make every letter lowercase / uppercase.
  - Remove all punctuation.
- Counting
  - How many letters are in the text?
  - How many words are in the text?
  - How many punctuation marks are in the text?
- Analyzing
  - What is the letter frequency?
  - What is the word frequency?
  - What are the 5 most common letters?
  - What are the 10 most common words?
  - What are the 10 _least_ common words?
  - How many sentences are in the text?
  - How many of the sentences are questions?
  - What is the most common interesting word?
  - What is the least common boring word?
  - Are there any misspelled words?
  
## Questions

Are all questions we ask about the data set purely objective?

What's the best way to answer subjective questions?

When did you find yourself putting together tools to answer multiple questions?

Were there any tools or techniques you don't know yet that would have been a better fit?

When you had a question about Python, what was the best source for answers? Were any kinds of questions easier to find answers for? Was there a resource that seemed like it would be more useful than it was?
